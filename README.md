I used CIFAR datasets to train my model and later used random images to predict outcomes. This model is perfectly working for supervised learning. CIFAR data can be found in tenserflow module. We don't need to download, rather we can import using tensorflow. 
I used train the cifar datasets and predicr some random image and it happend to be bird. Predicted and shown images are same.
